      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/lactose-intolerance/definition-facts#:~:text=While%20most%20infants%20can%20digest,world's%20population%20has%20lactose%20malabsorption.&text=Lactose%20malabsorption%20is%20more%20common,the%20world%20than%20in%20others.">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</a>, approximately <b>68%</b> of the human population suffers from some form of lactose intolerance.
        As a result, the rise of using plant-based milk has increased. From your local coffee store to big chains such as Starbucks, coffee shops have accustomed to serving drinks with plant-based drinks. However, the plant-based milk craze has grown out the lactose intolerant community, as many vegans and even meat-eaters prefer drinking oat, almond and soy milk.
        This begs the question: <em>Is plant-based milk healthier than cow's milk?</em> This question has been asked numerous times, and factors such as personal preference and bias, science, studies and overall nutrition of both types of milk have been compared to determine "the better choice". The infograph below from <a href="https://www.compoundchem.com">Compound Chem</a> lists how plant milk compares to cow's milk. But this infograph alone is not enough to determine "the better choice". Rather we have to define what does "the better choice" mean.</p>

    <p>There's no easy way to decide which milk is better: is plant-based better than cow's milk? Is cow's milk better than plant-based milk? There's a lot of skepticism around this topic because the term "better" is ambigious and means different things for different people:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Does better mean it has more nutrients and health benefits?</li>
      <li>Does better mean it has a better taste?</li>
      <li>Does better mean one is better for business than the other?</li>
      <li>Does better mean one is "simply better" than the other?</li>
    </ul>
      <p>In order to address these questions and determine the "better" choice, we need to do a full analysis on both types of milk and weigh the pros and cons against each other. </p>

    <p>Taste is subjective. There will be 1 million people who claim plant-based milk tastes better than cow's milk, and vice versa. This is due to preferences and what one grows up with. It is more likely that someone who has grown up drinking cow's milk would prefer it over oat or soy milk, whereas someone who has grown up drinking non-dairy milk would prefer oat milk over cow's milk.</p>
    <p><b>My personal opinion:</b> I've drank both dairy and non-dairy (plant-based) milk. And personally, I don't have a preference. They both taste very similar to me, if not slightly different. I usually buy iced coffees and drinks from coffee stores that come with oat milk already in it, and it doesn't strike any difference to me than if I chose to add cow's milk. On the contrary, my family only purchases cow's milk, so when I drink tea or coffee, or just plain milk at home, it's cow's milk. The taste is indifferent to me but others would disagree, which is why this topic is slightly controversial as everyone's taste and opinion is subjective to personal experiences.</p>

    <p>The question is: <i>Can plant-based milk benefit businesses?</i> According to <a href="https://www.univarsolutions.com/blog/food-ingredients-innovations/plant-based-revolution-milk">Univar Solutions</a>, plant-based milks are starting to take over dairy cases at the supermarket, with a <b>10%</b> growth rate.
    With the rise of plant-based milks being available to consumers, businesses are starting to gain more customers due to the inclusivity of plant-based milks for those who do not or cannot drink cow's milk. This also affects business chains such as Starbucks which now push out multiple oat milk based beverages to attract consumers and promote the various choices of milk available.
    However, the rise of plant-based milk will also impact the dairy industry. The rapid popularity of plant-based milks such as oat and almond milk impacts the amount of people that actually purchase cow's milk, which affects farmers and businesses that sell cow's milk. This not only decreases sales but poses risk for these businesses' futures as a majority of people are pushing towards purchasing plant-based milks only.
    Lastly, consumers are starting to focus on the preservation of the planet and put the people and planet first. Univar Solutions states that consumers are starting to look at the bigger picture before investing in brands, and focus on brands that have a positive impact on our environment. Plant-based milks are a good way to help the planet as they offer a lower environemntal impact on emissions, land usage and water when you compare this with cow's milk.

  <p>Plant-based products are typically packaged in recyclable and sustainable cartons, unlike cow's milk which typically is packaged in plastics, such as plastic bags in Canada (bagged milk), as shown in Figure 2 above. The amount of plastic that is used to package cow's milk, for example in Canada alone, is damaging to the environment and contributes to global pollution. With the packaging of plant-based milk, it promotes recycling and also reduces waste.

  <p>So to answer the original question, <i>"Is plant-based milk healthier than cow's milk?"</i>, there's no right or wrong because it is entirely up to you. If you are lactose intolerant or have an allergy that prohibits you from consuming dairy, then by all means drink plant-based milk. If you do not like plant-based milk, then drink cow's milk! Each type of milk has its pros and cons and both impact the world differently.
     While the packaging of cow's milk can be detrimental to the planet, its vitamins and minerals are necessary for our bodies, such as the calcium and vitamin D that it contains which help to strengthen our bones and teeth. And while plant-based milk do not contain these nutrients, it has lower calories, less sugar and typically has a more environment-friendly packaging.
     At the end of the day, it's about what makes you happy. If you find ways to reduce the waste of the packaging of cow's milk, such as reusing the packaging for something else or buying cow's milk in glass bottles, it can help the planet without feeling the guilt of buying cow's milk. If you prefer or must consume plant-based milk, it's important you take vitamins and minerals in the form of pills to ensure you are getting the supplies your body needs.
     So the next time you go to the grocery store and see a bunch of milk options, from cow to nuts to seeds and more, think about what <b>you</b> want to drink or use. If the oat milk makes you feel good, buy that! If you prefer the 2% bagged milk, buy it and think about how you can reuse the plastic to avoid waste. Really, there's no "better" option, it's only about what makes you happy and what you want.</p>
